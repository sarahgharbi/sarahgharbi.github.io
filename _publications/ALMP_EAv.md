excerpt: 'Subsidized employment has been widely used to tackle the prevalent problem of youth unemployment. In this study, we evaluate the impact of a subsidized employment program for disadvantaged youth in France and reveal significant gender differences in program effectiveness, hidden behind the average null effect. For men, the effects are significant and positive on all employment outcomes, on both extensive and intensive margins. In contrast, for women, the program fails to improve the likelihood of employment. We identify two reasons for such differences in program effectiveness. First, women are more likely to have children during the program and drop out of it. Second, we observe gender-based sorting into different job types at the start of subsidized employment. Men tend to secure cognitive tasks in public administration and industry, while women are likely to occupy routine non-cognitive roles in health and social services. Our results have important implications for future policy designs and evaluations.'
