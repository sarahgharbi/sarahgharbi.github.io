excerpt: 'Subsidized employment has been widely used to tackle unemployment. Nevertheless, our understanding of the gender-specific effects of these policies is limited. In this study, we assess the impact of a subsidized employment program in France. We apply a dynamic difference-in-differences approach. Older non-participating cohorts serve as a control group. 
On average, we find that the effect on the employment probability is close to zero and only marginally significant. This hides significant disparities across genders. For men, the effects are significant and positive on all outcomes. In contrast, for women, the program fails to enhance the likelihood of employment. We identify two reasons for such discrepancies. First, women are more likely to have children during the program, rendering the program detrimental to them. Additionally, we observe gender-based sorting into different job types at the start of subsidized employment. Men typically secure cognitive tasks in public administration or industry. Women tend to occupy routine non-cognitive roles in health and social services. Our results have important policy implications for both future policy evaluations and policy designs.'
