excerpt: 'I assess the real effects of a firm-level tax on production inputs, focusing on the 1999 reform of the French local business tax. This reform excluded the wage bill from the tax base, leaving only capital inputs taxed.  Using administrative data, I evaluate the impact of this reform on the firms‘ outcomes. I exploit cross-sectional variation in firms‘ exposure to the reform based on the labor share in their pre-reform tax base. Applying a dynamic differences-in-differences approach, I show that the reform significantly reduces firms‘ tax liabilities and boosts firms‘ productivity. This increase in productivity can be attributed to firms using a large portion of the tax savings for investment, particularly among cash-constrained firms. For a 1% reduction in
taxes, tangible assets increase by 0.69%. Wages are not affected. I estimate a negative effect on employment: for a  1% reduction in taxes, employment decreased by 0.13%. Importantly, this reduction does not indicate direct job cuts but reflects differences in employment growth rates between capital-intensive and labor-intensive firms, with capital-intensive firms increasing employment more rapidly. This difference in employment growth can be explained by varying degrees of tax sensitivity depending on whether firms can deduct business tax payments from the corporate income tax. '
