title: "Redesigning Taxes to Increase Economic Activity? Evidence from a French Business Tax Reform (JMP) [PDF](/files/JMP-Gharbi.pdf) "

excerpt: 'Empirical evidence of input-based taxes is scarce. I exploit a reform of the French local business tax that shifted the tax burden from both labor and capital to capital only. I apply a dynamic differences-in-differences approach leveraging cross-sectional variations in firms‘ exposure to the reform. Using rich administrative data, I show that the reform boosts firms‘ investment, particularly for those initially cash-constrained. For a 1% reduction in taxes, tangible assets increase by 0.43%. This generates significant productivity gains. Wages are not affected. I estimate a negative effect on employment. This reduction does not indicate direct job cuts but reflects differences in employment growth rates between capital-intensive and labor-intensive firms, with capital-intensive firms increasing employment more rapidly. I explain this difference by varying tax sensitivity based on whether firms can deduct business tax payments from the corporate income tax.'
