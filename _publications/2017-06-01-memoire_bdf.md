excerpt: 'This paper investigates the determinants of the government bond yield spreads. It focuses on
the elements related to fiscal policy. It also takes into account the tax compliance through an
interaction term between the primary balance accounting for the fiscal policy and the elasticity
of tax compliance to tax rate. As expected, we find that the effect of fiscal consolidation is
weakenned when the country has a low tax compliance. This effect is robust to a change in
fiscal policy proxy. The specification of the model enables us to distangle the effect of the fiscal
consolidation and that of the tax compliance. Finally we compute partial elasticity of government
bond yield spread to fiscal consolidation.'
