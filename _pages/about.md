I am a PhD candidate in Public Economics at the University of Cologne (Germany). I recently transferred from University of Mannheim. I previously worked as a researcher at ZEW -- Leibniz-Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung.


Before starting my PhD, I interned at the University of California
Santa Barbara as a research assistant with Pr. Youssef Benzarti, working on
taxation. I hold a MSc in Economics from ENSAE/Polytechnique where I specialized in Microeconomics
and Public Economics.
